# Geoportal Siedlce

This is my personal project about all decent places you can visit around Siedlce city. You can share it with your friends who wanna visit this small city.

## What's that?


### Tech used

Javascript
LeafletJS

## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mstosio/webmap.git
cd webmap/
npm install
```

### Installing / Getting started

Before running app, install needed dependencies.

```
npm install 
```

For running webpack devserver on your local machine:

```
npm start
```

For auto compiling SASS use:

```
npm run compile:sass
```

For bundling your files in development mode, this mode includes --watch and easily can work as live-server:

```
npm run dev
```

For bundling your files in production mode (the files will be compressed):

```
npm run build
```



Webpack config includes whole Babel config, so you are able to use ES6+ features.
